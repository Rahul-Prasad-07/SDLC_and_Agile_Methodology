Lecture	Notes – Software	Development	Lifecycle
Agile	and	Extreme	Programming


: Introduction	to	Agile :

-->Let’s	revisit	the	topics	learnt	in	the	introduction	to	Agile	segment.
In	this	segment,	you	learnt,	in	early	2000’s	how	fast-paced	and	changing	environment	of	software	
development	led	developers	to	come	up	with	suggestions	such	as	Agile	methodology.	Agile	
methodology	has	4	foundation	values	as	well	as	12	principles	around	those	values.	The	foundation	
values	are:
1. Individuals	and	interactions	over	processes	and	tools.
2. Working	software	over	comprehensive	documentation.
3. Customer	collaboration	over	contract	negotiation.
4. Responding to	change	over	following	a	plan

: Agile	Manifesto:	Principles :

You	learnt	the	12	principles	of	Agile	are:
1. Customer	satisfaction	— Customer	satisfaction	is	a	need	in	Agile	and	it	is	implemented	through	
releasing	the	software	often	with	frequent	feedback	taken	from	the	customer.
2. Welcome	change	— In	Agile,	we	welcome	change	at	every	iteration.
3. Working	software	— We	release	the	working	software	at	each	iteration.
4. Collaboration	— We	encourage	frequent	discussion	with	business	team.	
5. Motivation	— We	encourage	motivation	in	the	team.
6. Face-to-face	— We	encourage	face-to-face	interaction	with	among	team.
7. Measure	the	progress	through	working	software	— We	measure	progress	of	the	development	
through	no	of	functionalities	the	last	release	has	given.
8. Constant pace	— In	Agile	constant	pace	of	development	is	promoted	which	leaves	the	chance	
of	last	minute	burnout.
9. Continuous	attention	— We	encourage	continuous	attention.
10. Simplicity	— Simplicity	in	code	is	preferred	in	Agile	because	it	leaves	minimal	complications.
11. Self-organized	teams	— Team	should	be	encouraged	to	have	self-organized	and	can	take	
necessary	steps	to	meet	the	responsibilities	and	deadlines
Review	the	work	regularly	— Reviewing	the	work	regularly	gives	opportunity	to	improve	in	every	
iteration.


: What	Is	Extreme	Programming? :

You	learned	in	this	segment,	Extreme	programming	(XP)	is	a	software	development	methodology	that	
focuses	on	changing	user	needs,	along	with	the	development	of	software,	while	maintaining	
efficiency	within	teams.	Extreme Programming	advocated	to	start	testing	first	and	then	write	the	bare	
minimum	code	to	meet	the	required	functionality	without	any	bug.	You	learned	how	old	preferred	
process	stretched	to	practices	of	‘extreme’	programming.
It	is	an	implementation	of	Agile	methodology	just	like	SCRUM.

: Values	and	Practices	of	Extreme	Programming :

In	this	segment,	we	explored	the	value	and	practices	of	extreme	programming:
Values	of	extreme	programming:
1. Communication	— It	values	effective communication	which	enhances	productivity.
2. Simplicity	— Bare	minimum	simple	code	is	written	completing	the	required	functionalities.
3. Feedback	— At	every	iteration	feedback	is	given	so	that	suggested	improvements	don’t	pile	up.
4. Courage	— Focus	only	on	what matters,	accepting	feedback,	telling	the	truth	about	progress,	
gives	a	programmer	courage.
5. Respect	— Extreme	programming	teaches	respecting	other	team	members	so	that	you	remain	
conscious	and	consider	saving	others	from	reworking.
Practices	of	extreme	programming:
1. User	stories	— Requirement	are	broken	down	into	short	and	crisp	user	stories.
2. Planning	game	— User	stories	are	then	converted	into	tasks.
3. Short	releases	— Short	releases	are	planned	so	that	we	get	constant	feedback	after	each	
iteration.
4. Metaphor	— Software	architectures	are	discussed	in	simple	terms	with	help	of	metaphors.
5. Simple	design	— Design	and	development	are	kept	simple	with	writing	just	enough	code.
6. Testing	— Along	with	development	constant	testing	is	done	leaving	the	chance	of	postproduction	bugs.
7. Refactoring	— Constant	refactoring	is	in	order	to	simplify	the	code.
8. Pair	programming	— A	quality	engineer	and	software	engineer	or	a	two	software	engineer	sit	
together	constantly	reviewing	and	writing	the	code.
9. Collective	ownership	— Entire	team	is	considered	to	be	accountable	for	the	delivery.
10.Continuous	integration	— Code	is	committed	to	the	central	database	every	few	hours	so	that	
development	efforts	don’t	remain	fragmented.
11.40-hour	week	— Team	should	spend	40-hour	a	week	on	the	project	to	ensure	the	good	
productivity.
12.On-site	customer	— Customer	should	sit	with	the	developer	teams	for	faster	feedback	and	
resolution	cycle.
13.Coding	standard	— Team	should	maintain	a	good	coding	standard.


: Advantages	of	Extreme	Programming :

Advantages	of	extreme	programming,	you	learnt,	are:
1. No	slipped	schedules
2. No	cancelled	projects
3. No	cost	incurred	due	to	changes
4. No	production	and	post-delivery	defects
5. No	misunderstanding	of	the	business	requirements
6. No	change	aversion
7. No	staff	turnover

: User	Stories :

A	user	story	is	short	and	crisp	description	of	requirements	in	the	format	of	—
“As	a	<type	of	user>,	I	want	<some	goal>	so	that	<some	reason>”
E.g.	As	a	user,	I	should	be	able	to	print	all	the	listed	documents	with	their	details.	Before	printing	
them	I	should	be	able	to	see	the	print	preview	in	the	browser	only	so	that	I	can	decide	the	format	in	
which	I	want	to	print	the	document.
While	anyone	can	write	user	stories,	primarily	it’s	the	job	of	product	owner.	Later	on	theses	user	
stories	are	prioritized	for	creating	the	order	of	development.

  
: Comprehensive	User	Stories	and	Backlog	Documents :
  
Goal	of	a	user	story	is	to	understand	the	requirement	correctly	and,	engineering	team	should	be	able	
to	estimate	the	time	required	to	develop	it.	Sometimes	user	stories,	called	EPICS,	needs	to	be	broken	
into	smaller	user	stories.	Then	conditions	of	satisfaction	is	added	as	a	criteria	of	completion	for	the	
user	stories.	Conditions	of	satisfaction	should	conform	to	INVEST	criteria	which	is	a	short	form	of	
independent,	negotiable,	valuable,	estimable,	small	and	testable.	A	backlog	document	is	the	list	of	
user	stories	created	from	breaking	requirements.	It	keeps	track	of	the	development	through	various	
parameter.	A	grooming	session	is	kept	periodically	to	add,	delete	or	edit	the	user	stories	from	backlog	
document.

: Estimation	and	Planning :
 
There	are	various	estimation	techniques	used	to	quantify	the	efforts	required	to	develop	the	user	
story.	Some	of	them	are:
1. Story	points
2. T-shirt	sizing
3. Largest	estimate
4. Relative	mass
And	planning	techniques	are	the	process	through	which	we	come	to	a estimation.	Various	planning	
techniques	are:
1. Planning	poker
2. Affinity	planning
3. Bucket	system
4. Big/uncertain/small
5. Dot	voting
  
: Planning	Poker :

Planning	poker	technique	is	used	to	determine	the	estimation	that	will	take	to	develop	the	user	story.	
In	this	technique,	each	participant	chooses	to	give	an	estimation,	typically	from	the	Fibonacci	series.	
The	largest	and	the	smallest	estimators	explain	the	reasons	for	an	estimation.	Discussion	and	
reconsideration	is	carried	out.	After	few	round	either	team	comes	to	an	agreement	or	average	of	all	
the	estimations	is	taken	as	the	final	one.	Planning	poker	ends	when	all	the	user	stories	are	discussed.
